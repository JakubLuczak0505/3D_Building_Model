<h1>3D Building Model for KARNAGE</h1>

<h2>Info</h2>
This model was created for KARNAGE, a 3D retro-style FPS game very similar to older, popular games like DOOM and Quake. The model was designed based on various drawings and consultations with the client. I designed three drawings and then sent them to the client. The client informed me that the second model design was most suitable for KARNAGE. To create this model, I used Tinkercad. The program allowed me to select various shapes and model them by creating the building's walls. Then, using the program's tool, I cut holes in these walls to give the model a dilapidated and abandoned look, which helped the model fit the game. I chose silver and blue colors for the model to achieve a futuristic look for KARNAGE.
